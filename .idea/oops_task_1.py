##Write a Python program to create a Vehicle class with speed and mileage instance attributes

# class Vehicle():
#     def __init__(self, mileage,speed):
#         self.mileage=milage
#         self.speed=speed
#         print(self.mileage,self.speed)
#
# car=Vehicle("25",230)
# bike=Vehicle("90",85)

# 2. create a vehicle class without variable and method

# class Vehicle():
#     pass

#3. Define a property that must have the same value for every class instance (object)


#4. Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

# def cps():
#
#     for i in range(10):
#         j=i-1
#         sum = i + i-1
#         print(f"Current Number: {i}, Previous Number: {j}, Sum: {sum}")
#
# cps()
