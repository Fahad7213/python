#1.Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list
# clr = ["red", "blue", "pacha", "green"]
# print(clr[0])
# print(clr[-1])

# 2.Write a Python program to sum two given integers.
#   However, if the sum is between 15 and 20 it will return 20


# def sum_integers(a, b):
#     total = a + b
#     if total > 15 and total< 20:
#         return 20
#     else:
#         print(total)
#         return 0
#
# r=sum_integers(12,11)
# print(r)



#3..Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 20

#method1 (using comprahence)
# even=[i for i in range(1,21) if i%2==0]
# print(even)

#method2
# for i in range(1,21):
#     if i % 2==0:
#         print(i)

#4 Write a program to print the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
# c=int(input("enter a number"))
# for i in range(c):
#     cube=i*3
#     print(cube)


# 5. Create a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter a negative number.
   # Print the sum of all the positive numbers entered by the user,
   # terminating the loop when a negative number is entered using a break statement




#
# for i in range(a):
#     if i > 0:
#         sum=sum+i
#     else:
#         break
#
# print(sum)


# sum=0
# while True:
#     a = int(input("enetr numbers"))
#
#     if a<0:
#         break;
#     sum=sum+a
# print(sum)
